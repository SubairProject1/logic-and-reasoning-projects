As expected the result was UNSAT, meaning there is no interpretation that can make it true.
It is NOT possible to assign 3 pigeons to 2 holes so that every pigeon occupies some hole
and no hole contains more than one pigeon. The SAT solver executed in just 0.28 seconds, 
demonstrating high efficiency. It processed 32 variables and 12 clauses, with 2 conflicts 
and 1 learned unit clause during its operation.

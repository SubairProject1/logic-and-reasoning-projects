# Logic and Reasoning in Computer Science – Project Work

This repository contains independently completed project assignments for the course Logic and Reasoning in Computer Science. The projects involve SAT solving, SMT solving, and first-order logic encodings using DIMACS CNF, TPTP, Python, and SMT-LIB2. Assignment description can be found at the very end of the uploaded pdf files.

## Project Problem 1.1 – Pigeonhole Principle (SAT Encoding)

Language: DIMACS CNF

Encoded the 3-pigeons-2-holes problem as a propositional SAT instance, produced CNF in DIMACS format, executed a SAT solver, and analyzed the unsatisfiable result.

## Project Problem 1.2 – Exam Scheduling via SAT

Language: Python

Built a SAT-based exam scheduler respecting student conflicts and room capacities, generated a SAT instance, solved it, and reconstructed a valid timetable.

## Project Problem 2.1 – TPTP Encoding (First-Order Logic)

Language: TPTP

Encoded a first-order logic problem in TPTP format, documented the meaning of each clause via comments, ran Vampire on the encoding, and interpreted solver output.

## Project Problem 2.2 – TPTP Encoding (Second FOL Scenario)

Language: TPTP

Provided a full TPTP formulation for a second logical specification, executed Vampire, and analyzed satisfiability results according to the project instructions.

## Project Problem 3.1 – Program Semantics with SMT

Language: SMT-LIB2

Modelled a small program using arrays and arithmetic, encoded it in SMT-LIB2, evaluated reachability with Z3, and explained solver output.

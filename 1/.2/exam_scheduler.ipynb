    "# Exam Scheduling\n",
    "After spending all spring break chasing Easter eggs, the faculty professors no longer have time to schedule exams. You and your peers fear that this will result in a disastrous result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students are never happy studying for exams. However, they are even less happy when they have to take two exams on the same day.\n",
    "Willing to show your mastery of propositional logic, you decide to compute a schedule to submit to the professors that will make everyone happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list of students and the exams they have to take. Your task is to find a satisfactory schedule using a SAT solver. That is, a schedule such that every exam is planned in a room with enough capacity for all students taking the exam while avoiding multiple exams on the same day. In other words:\n",
    "- each exam is planned exactly once, in a room with enough capacity for all students taking the exam;\n",
    "- a room can host at most one exam at a time;\n",
    "- no student has two exams on the same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "You have to:\n",
    "- implement the functions `encode_cnf` and `decode_model` in the \"exam_scheduler.py\" file;\n",
    "- use the provided template;\n",
    "- briefly describe your encoding in the python file;\n",
    "- submit the \"exam_scheduler.py\" python file with your solution.\n",
    "- submit a singled file name \"proj2.[pdf/txt/md]\" with a brief description of your solution. Evaluate how your approach scales with the number of students and exams. Estimate the number of variables and clauses that your encoding generates depending on the number of students, days, courses, and rooms. This document should not be more than two pages long (except if you addressed the pigeonhole problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may:\n",
    "- write any additional function you need;\n",
    "- use global variables, while it is not recommended, it is allowed to make your code cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not:\n",
    "- use any external library (except for the ones already imported in the template);\n",
    "- print anything on the standard output and standard error in your final solution;\n",
    "- modify the signature of the functions (the automatic tests will fail otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are advised to:\n",
    "- test your program;\n",
    "- keep your code clean and readable;\n",
    "- write comments to explain your reasoning;\n",
    "- experiment corner cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Warning\n",
    "We will use some automatic tests as sanity checks for your implementation. If you do not respect the output format or your code throws an error, you will get 0 points for the failed tests. Make sure to test your implementation."
